## 🔮 Phase 1: Enhancement & Expansion

Phase 1 items are now tracked as **beads issues** for proper project management.

### High-Level Goals

1. **Enhanced Testing**
   - Integration tests for complete workflows
   - Property-based testing for validators
   - Mocked external command testing
   - Coverage improvement (target: 25-30%)

2. **Python Support**
   - Pytest configuration and test suite
   - Pylint for code quality
   - Python coverage tracking

3. **CI/CD Extensions**
   - GitLab CI configuration
   - Status badges
   - Performance benchmarking

4. **Developer Experience**
   - E2E test suite
   - Snapshot testing for outputs
   - Improved documentation

### Tracking

All Phase 1 tasks are documented in [TODOS_FOR_BEADS.md](TODOS_FOR_BEADS.md) with:
- Detailed descriptions
- Acceptance criteria
- Priority levels
- Effort estimates
- Labels for organization

**To convert to beads issues**: Follow instructions in `TODOS_FOR_BEADS.md`
